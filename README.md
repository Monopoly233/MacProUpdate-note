# MacProUpdate-note&log 
this is a MacPro2009 Upgrade note for myself

It is not that easy so I have to record those process

to remind me in next update

##How did it all begin

I acquired this Mac Pro 2009 probably two or three years ago, and then, following various online tutorials, I managed to update it to macOS13.4.1 a few months ago

Over the past two to three years, I gradually installed modern hardware components into my Mac Pro. These include a Wi-Fi-enabled network card, two SATA storage drives, and an RX580 4GB graphics card. I also upgraded the CPU to two X5690 processors and increased the memory to 128GB

It took me a considerable amount of time and money, but each time I updated, I had to repeatedly seek help for the same issues. So, this document is intended to record all the problems that occur during system updates
